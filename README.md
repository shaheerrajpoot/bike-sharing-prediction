"# Bike Sharing Prediction Project" 
🚴 Bike Sharing Prediction Project
📌 Overview
This project predicts hourly bike rental demand using time-series data from a bike sharing system.
The goal is to build models that help understand patterns in bike usage and forecast future demand based on time, season, and weather conditions.

This is an end-to-end data science project that includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)

Model evaluation and comparison

Interactive visualizations

📂 Dataset
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.

hour.csv → Hourly bike rental data

day.csv → Daily bike rental data

Key Columns:

dteday → Date

hr → Hour of the day

temp → Normalized temperature

atemp → Feeling temperature

hum → Humidity

windspeed → Wind speed

cnt → Total bike rentals (our target variable)

⚙️ Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling categorical variables (season, weather, etc.)

Feature scaling

Time-based feature extraction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trends by hour, day, season, weather

Correlation analysis

Modeling Approaches

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA / Prophet / LSTM)

Evaluation

Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²

Compare performance across models

📊 Results
Visualized bike demand trends (daily & hourly)

Identified key factors influencing demand (weather, time, season)

Built predictive models with strong accuracy

🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Forecasting: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)

Dashboarding (Optional): Streamlit / Power BI

🚀 Future Work
Deploy model as a web app (Streamlit/Flask)

Build an interactive dashboard for decision makers

Extend analysis to include external factors (holidays, events, etc.)
